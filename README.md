# rp2040_spectro

A basic oscilloscope/frequency plotter for the RP2040 chip from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

Designed around an [Adafruit Feather RP2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-pico) with an [128x64 OLED featherwing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-128x64-oled-featherwing), but should work with an RP2040 based board (e.g. rpi pico) hooked up to a similar appropriate OLED screen and controller.
